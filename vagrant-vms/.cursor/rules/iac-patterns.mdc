# Infrastructure as Code (IAC) Patterns

## Complete Stack Provisioning
- Install all required packages in a single provisioning script
- Configure services and start them automatically
- Set up databases with proper users and permissions
- Deploy applications with proper configuration

## WordPress IAC Stack
- Apache2 web server with PHP modules
- MySQL database server
- WordPress application deployment
- Virtual host configuration
- Database user creation and privileges
- Configuration file automation

## Finance Website IAC Stack
- Apache (httpd) web server
- Website deployment from external source
- File extraction and deployment
- Service configuration and restart

## Automation Best Practices
- Use inline shell scripts for simple configurations
- Download and extract applications automatically
- Configure services to start on boot
- Set proper file permissions and ownership
- Clean up temporary files after deployment

## Configuration Management
- Use sed for configuration file modifications
- Create configuration files with heredoc syntax
- Set environment-specific variables
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Service Dependencies
- Install packages before configuring services
- Start services in the correct order
- Restart services after configuration changes
- Enable services for automatic startup

## Error Handling
- Use `-y` flags for non-interactive installation
- Use `-o` flags for overwriting existing files
- Check for successful command execution
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Security Considerations
- Create dedicated database users
- Set proper file permissions
- Use secure passwords in development
- Configure services with minimal privileges
