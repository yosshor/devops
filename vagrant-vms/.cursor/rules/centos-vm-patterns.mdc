# CentOS VM Configuration Patterns

## Box Selection
- Use `eurolinux-vagrant/centos-stream-9` for CentOS Stream 9
- CentOS Stream provides rolling updates and latest packages

## Package Management
- Use `yum install` for package installation
- Install packages with `-y` flag for non-interactive installation
- Use `yum update` for system updates
- Install development tools with `yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`

## Service Management
- Use `systemctl` for service management
- Enable services with `systemctl enable`
- Start services with `systemctl start`
- Restart services with `systemctl restart`
- Check service status with `systemctl status`

## Web Server Configuration
- Apache (httpd) is the primary web server
- Use `systemctl start httpd` to start Apache
- Use `systemctl enable httpd` to enable on boot
- Configure virtual hosts in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/`
- Document root is `/var/www/html/`

## File Operations
- Use `mkdir -p` for creating directories with parents
- Use `cp -r` for recursive copying
- Use `rm -rf` for recursive deletion
- Use `wget` for downloading files
- Use `unzip -o` for overwriting existing files

## Temporary File Management
- Use `/tmp/` directory for temporary files
- Clean up temporary files after use
- Use descriptive subdirectories in `/tmp/`

## Network Configuration
- Use private network IP 192.168.56.x range
- Configure public network with bridge adapter
- Use consistent network adapter naming

## Security Considerations
- Install security updates regularly
- Configure firewall rules as needed
- Use proper file permissions
- Consider SELinux policies for production
